1.3 Given a scenario, perform vulnerability management activities


<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vulnerability identification:</span>

* **Asset Criticality**: Determine the value, function, and impact of each asset on an organization's operations, data, and services. Rank them based on their significance to business objectives and potential consequences of compromise or disruption
* **Active vs. Passive Scanning**: Active scanning involves probing and interacting with the target system. Passive scanning observes and collects information without directly engaging with the system
* **Mapping and Enumeration**: Systematically scanning and probing the network to discover and identify active hosts, services, and devices as an assessment of the network's security posture and potential vulnerabilities

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Validation:</span>

* **True Positive**: Scanner correctly identifies existing vulnerability
* **False Positive**: Scanner reports a vulnerability that actually doesn’t exist on the system being scanned (verify patch/versions, or attempt actual attack)
* **True Negative**: Scanner correctly doesn’t alert on non-existent vulnerability
* **False Negative**: Scanner incorrectly doesn’t alert on vulnerability that actually exists on the system being scanned

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Remediation/mitigation:</span>

* **Configuration Baseline**: Perform anomaly detection to determine any deviations from the baseline (by using Snort, Suricata, Bro/Zeek, ELK Stack, Splunk, Weka, TensorFlow, etc.)
* **Patching**: Automate software deployments, updates, and security patches to protect the network infrastructure from known threats (using Ansible for Linux, or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) for Microsoft)
* **Hardening**: Disable unnecessary ports/services, configure firewalls, encrypt data in transit and data at rest, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforce principle of least privilege, and regularly patch and update
* **Compensating Controls**: If upgrades and/or patches are unavailable, isolate the system and place compensating controls in front
* **Risk Acceptance**: After determining the Annual Loss Expectancy, it might best suit the business to simply accept the risk and refrain from taking any action against it, if the mitigation cost is more than the expected loss
* **Verification of Mitigation**: Audits (formal), assessments (informal), patch consistently, automate repeated vulnerability scans

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Scanning parameters and criteria:</span>

* **Risks associated with scanning activities**: Vulnerability scans consume bandwidth and resources, and risk business process interruptions (solution: fine-tune intensity and scan times)

1. **CCE** (Common Configuration Enumeration) - CCE codes are used to provide a consistent, unique identifier for specific configuration settings 
2. **CPE** (Common Platform Enumeration) - CPE codes are used to represent specific products or platforms 
3. **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) - CVE standardizes the identification of vulnerabilities across many systems and platforms
4. **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) - CVSS indicates the level of severity that a given vulnerability can result in
5. **XCCDF** (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) - XCCDF helps organizations check their compliance against a list of standard security configurations

* **Scope**: The extent of a vulnerability scan (included systems/networks, host discovery methods, what tests will be conducted against active hosts)
* **Credentialed vs Non-credentialed**: Credentialed scans use valid login credentials to access the target system (enabling deeper and more comprehensive scanning). Non-credentialed scans conduct assessments without authentication, providing limited visibility into the system
* **Server-based vs Agent-based**: Server-based scans are conducted from a centralized server or scanning appliance (scanning multiple targets remotely). Agent-based scans use lightweight software agents installed on individual machines to perform local scans and report back to the central server
* **Internal vs External**: Internal scans are conducted from within the network perimeter, whereas external scans are performed from outside the network, evaluating the organization's internet-facing systems and identifying potential vulnerabilities visible to external attackers

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Special considerations for vulnerability management:</span>

* **Types of data**: Protected Health Information (**PHI**), Payment Card Industry (**PCI-DSS**), Personally Identifiable Information (**PII**), Non-public Personal Information (**NPI**), Sensitive Personal Information (**SPI**), and Intellectual Property (**IP**)
